# SecretKeeper

**Homomorphic secret management with Zama FHEVM**

SecretKeeper provides encrypted secret storage where secret content and metadata remain encrypted during storage, retrieval, and processing. Built on Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption Virtual Machine, the platform enables operations over encrypted secrets without decryption, ensuring absolute confidentiality while maintaining functionality.

---

## Platform Description

SecretKeeper is a decentralized secret management system that solves the fundamental challenge of secure secret storage: maintaining confidentiality while enabling useful operations. Traditional secret managers decrypt secrets for any operation, creating security risks. SecretKeeper uses Zama FHEVM to perform operations—search, categorization, access control—over encrypted secrets without ever decrypting them.

**Primary Function**: Store, organize, and manage secrets with cryptographic privacy guarantees and verifiable operations.

## Secret Lifecycle

### Secret Creation

**Storage Process:**
1. User encrypts secret content locally using FHE public key
2. Metadata encrypted (tags, categories, timestamps)
3. Encrypted secret submitted to smart contract
4. Secret stored as encrypted ciphertext
5. User receives encrypted receipt

**What Gets Encrypted:**
- Secret content (passwords, keys, notes)
- Secret metadata (tags, categories)
- Access timestamps
- Usage statistics

### Secret Retrieval

**Access Process:**
1. User requests secret by encrypted identifier
2. Contract verifies access permissions (homomorphic)
3. Encrypted secret retrieved from storage
4. Encrypted metadata accessed
5. User decrypts secret locally

**Privacy:**
- Secret content never decrypted on-chain
- Retrieval operations encrypted
- Access logs encrypted
- No plaintext exposure

### Secret Operations

**Homomorphic Processing:**
- Search secrets over encrypted content
- Filter by encrypted tags
- Sort by encrypted timestamps
- Aggregate encrypted statistics

**All Without Decryption:**

- Access control setup

### Secret Search Workflow

**Homomorphic Search:**
1. User encrypts search query
2. Encrypted query submitted to contract
3. Contract searches over encrypted secrets
4. Encrypted matches identified
5. Encrypted results returned
6. User decrypts results locally

**Privacy:**
- Search terms encrypted
- Search results encrypted
- No query exposure
- Private search functionality

### Secret Sharing Workflow

**Encrypted Sharing:**
1. Owner encrypts secret for sharing
2. Encrypts recipient identifier
3. Grants access (encrypted permissions)
4. Recipient receives encrypted secret
5. Recipient decrypts locally

**Security:**
- Shared secrets remain encrypted
- Access controlled cryptographically

## Smart Contract System

### Secret Storage Contract

```solidity
contract SecretKeeper {
    struct EncryptedSecret {
        euint8[] content;          // Encrypted secret content
        euint8[] metadata;        // Encrypted metadata
        bytes32 contentHash;      // Integrity hash
        address owner;            // Public owner
        PermissionSet permissions; // Encrypted permissions
    }
    
    mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => EncryptedSecret)) private secrets;
    
    function storeSecret(
        bytes calldata encryptedContent,
        bytes calldata encryptedMetadata,
        bytes32 hash
    ) external returns (uint256 secretId);
    
    function retrieveSecret(uint256 secretId)
        external
        view
        returns (bytes memory encryptedContent);
    
    function searchSecrets(bytes calldata encryptedQuery)
        external
        view
        returns (uint256[] memory matchingIds);
    
    function shareSecret(
        uint256 secretId,
        address recipient,
        bytes calldata encryptedPermissions
    ) external;
}
```

### Homomorphic Functions

**Secret Search:**
```solidity
function searchOverEncrypted(
    bytes calldata encryptedQuery,
    EncryptedSecret[] secrets
) internal view returns (uint256[] matches) {
    for (uint i = 0; i < secrets.length; i++) {
        ebool matches = TFHE.eq(
            secrets[i].content,
            encryptedQuery
        );
        if (matches) {
            matches.push(i);
        }
    }
}
```

**Access Control:**
```solidity
ebool hasAccess = TFHE.and(
    TFHE.eq(encryptedPermissions.readAccess, true),
    TFHE.gt(currentTime, encryptedPermissions.expiration)
);
```

## Security Best Practices

### Secret Management

**Best Practices:**
- Use strong FHE keys (hardware wallet storage)
- Rotate keys periodically
- Backup encrypted secrets separately
- Use threshold key management for critical secrets

**Avoid:**
- Sharing FHE private keys
- Storing keys in plaintext
- Weak key generation
- Single point of failure

### Operational Security

**Recommendations:**
- Regular security audits
- Monitor access patterns (aggregate level)
- Implement access timeouts
- Use multi-factor authentication (wallet + key)

**Compliance:**
- Maintain audit trails (encrypted)
- Implement retention policies
- Follow data protection regulations
- Regular security reviews

## FAQ

**Q: How secure are secrets if they're stored on a public blockchain?**  
A: Secrets are encrypted with FHE before storage. Only encrypted ciphertexts are on-chain, and all operations happen over encrypted data. Secrets are never decrypted on-chain.

**Q: Can I search my secrets without exposing search terms?**  
A: Yes! SecretKeeper performs homomorphic search over encrypted secrets. Your search queries are encrypted, and results are computed without decryption.

**Q: What happens if I lose my FHE private key?**  
A: Without your private key, you cannot decrypt your secrets. We recommend secure key backup using hardware wallets and threshold key management for critical secrets.

**Q: Can secrets be shared securely?**  
A: Yes. SecretKeeper supports encrypted secret sharing where secrets remain encrypted even when shared, and access is controlled through encrypted permissions.

**Q: How expensive is secret storage?**  
A: Storage costs depend on secret size. Small secrets cost ~200k gas, while larger secrets can cost more. Large secrets can be stored off-chain with content hashes on-chain for efficiency.
