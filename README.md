# SecureKeepSecret

**A Next-Generation Privacy-First Secret Management Platform**

SecureKeepSecret is an innovative decentralized application that revolutionizes how we store and manage sensitive information. Built on cutting-edge Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology and deployed on Ethereum, it provides unprecedented privacy and security for your most important data.

## 🔐 What Makes SecureKeepSecret Unique?

### **True Privacy Through FHE**
Unlike traditional password managers that decrypt your data on their servers, SecureKeepSecret uses Fully Homomorphic Encryption to perform operations on encrypted data without ever decrypting it. Your secrets remain encrypted even during processing.

### **Decentralized Architecture**
Your secrets are stored on the Ethereum blockchain, eliminating single points of failure and ensuring no central authority can access your data. The power is truly in your hands.

### **Hybrid Encryption System**
We combine ChaCha20 symmetric encryption with FHE password protection, creating a robust multi-layered security approach that's both efficient and secure.

### **Client-Side Decryption**
All decryption happens in your browser using your wallet's private key. Your secrets never leave your device in unencrypted form.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **🔒 End-to-End Encryption**: Your data is encrypted before leaving your device
- **🌐 Blockchain Storage**: Decentralized storage on Ethereum ensures data integrity
- **🔑 Wallet Integration**: Use your existing Web3 wallet for authentication
- **⚡ Real-Time Operations**: Store, retrieve, and manage secrets instantly
- **🛡️ Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: Even we can't see your encrypted data
- **📱 Modern UI**: Clean, intuitive interface built with React and TypeScript
- **🔧 Developer Friendly**: Open source with comprehensive documentation

- Ethereum Sepolia testnet ETH (for testing)

### **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/soofaam/SecureKeepSecret.git
   cd SecureKeepSecret
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your configuration
